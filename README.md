# Split-ClvR

In this repository are the functions (ClvR_functions.py) and two simulations (multi_run and heatmap, ClvR_simulation.ipynb) to play with various parameters for each of the drives presented in our paper: Split versions of Cleave and Rescue selfish genetic elements for measured self limiting gene drive. The latter provides an overview and explicit rules about parameters for each drive.

You will also need the cross-matrices (and other assorted drive-specific information contained in so called 'master_lists', ClvR_dict), which is a large 12GB file that can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4rHntnw7nNUZ8AEygm8ylTncGh6UJuE/view?usp=sharing

The code was done via python and jupyter lab notebooks, if you don't have the means to open and run these files you can download python version 3.8 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/ and anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. The latter has multiple shells in which to run python/ jupyter lab notebooks, the two easiest to use are both browser based: JupyterLab or jupyter notebook.

Once you have all three of our files downloaded and some shell to run jupyter notebooks in, you can start playing wit our models in ClvR_simulation.ipynb.
